    "# Getting started with controlled-source electromagnetic 1D modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Dieter Werthmüller$^1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward modeling is an important part of understanding controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) responses. The diffusive term in the electromagnetic wave equation is dominant over the displacement term at these frequencies. It is the diffusive behavior that makes it difficult to imagine the actual propagation of the signal. An important tool in gaining experience therefore is forward modeling, and lots of it. The advantage of one-dimensional (1D) forward modeling, besides its speed, is to study isolated effects (see for instance [Key, 2009](#References)): What is the influence of resistivity anisotropy, or of fine-scale resistivity variations? What is the influence of the airwave? With 1D modeling you can quickly study these effects in isolation before you go on to more complex models in higher dimensions. For an introduction to CSEM for hydrocarbon exploration see, for instance [Constable (2010)](#References).\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily the EM community can count on some freely available, stable, high-quality, and open-source CSEM modeling codes. Well-known ones are the codes from the Marine EM Lab at Scripps: `DIPOLE1D` ([Key, 2009](#References)) and `MARE2DEM` ([Key and Ovall, 2011](#References)) for 1D and 2D modeling. `DIPOLE1D` is an isotropic EM modeler for a stratified model using the diffusive approximation valid for low frequencies such as used in CSEM (neglecting displacement currents). `MARE2DEM` is a 2.5D CSEM and magnetotelluric (MT) modeling and inversion code, including resistivity anisotropy. More recently, [Cockett et al. (2015)](#References) published `SimPEG` , and [Hunziker et al. (2015)](#References) `EMmod` . `SimPEG` is a framework for 3D simulation and modeling of all sorts of geophysical methods, among them CSEM. `EMmod` is a 1D electromagnetic modeler including anisotropy in the form of vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) resistivity as well as VTI electric permittivity and VTI magnetic permeability, therefore modeling the whole wavefield for electric and magnetic sources and receivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, I use the 1D electromagnetic forward modeling code `empymod`. The code is published under a permissive open-source license and available at [github.com/prisae/empymod](https://github.com/prisae/empymod). It is based on [Hunziker et al. (2015)](#References) for the wavenumber-domain calculation, and on [Key (2012)](#References) for the Hankel and Fourier transforms. The electromagnetic Python modeler `empymod` can model electric or magnetic responses due to a three-dimensional electric or magnetic source in a layered earth model (Figure 1) with $n$ layers, each with electric vertical isotropy ($\\rho_\\text{h}$, $\\lambda$), horizontal and vertical electric permittivity ($\\epsilon_\\text{h}$, $\\epsilon_\\text{v}$), and horizontal and vertical magnetic permeability ($\\mu_\\text{h}$, $\\mu_\\text{v}$), from very low frequencies ($f \\to$ 0 Hz) to very high frequencies ($f \\to$ GHz). The layer parameters all default to 1 if not provided ($\\rho_\\text{h}$ is mandatory).\n",

    "-  frequency of $2\\,$Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function bipole takes up to 24 arguments, but 19 of those have default values. We only have to provide the five mandatory parameters for this simple example: sources, receivers, depths of the interfaces, resistivities, and frequencies:\n",
    "\n",

    "    >>> inp1 = {'src': [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n",

    "\n",
    "From this example, you can infer that an infinitesimally small *dipole* is defined as $[x, y, z,$ azimuth, dip$]$, using a left-handed coordinate system with positive z pointing downward. The azimuth is the anti-clockwise deviation from the x-axis, and the dip is the deviation downward from the xy-plane. A finite length *bipole*, on the other hand, would be defined as $[x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2, z_1, z_2]$, where $[x_1, y_1, z_1]$ is the first pole location, and $[x_2, y_2, z_2]$ is the second pole location. We will see in the next example why the frequency parameter is called `freqtime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default verbosity reveals that `empymod` took some milliseconds to run on my machine, and three kernel calls were required. This is because our receiver has an arbitrary rotation, so it had to calculate the x-, y-, and z-fields due to an x-directed source. And it returns a complex number, the result."

    "## Anisotropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Anisotropic CSEM modeling, more specifically vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) modeling, is the normal case these days (unlike 10 years ago). Resistivity anisotropy $\\lambda$ and mean resistivity ρ m are commonly defined in terms of horizontal ($\\rho_\\text{h}$) and vertical ($\\rho_\\text{v}$) resistivity as:\n",

    "\n",
    "A common mistake is to only speak about *increasing anisotropy*, without further specification. As can be seen from the above relationship, *increasing anisotropy* is ambiguous.  The relationship between the three resistivities is elaborated in detail in [Werthmüller (2009)](#References). An example of this ambiguity is given in Figure 3; the code to produce it is in the accompanying notebook.\n",

    "These results show that stating “increasing anisotropy” can mean quite different things, and it is crucial to specify it more, for instance “increasing anisotropy by keeping the mean resistivity constant.” The isotropic case, the black line, is the same in all three plots. We can draw the following conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The initial step, the airwave, depends only on $\\rho_\\text{h}$.\n",

    "Jupyter and the `ipywidgets` make it incredibly easy to create interactive plots, which I use in the notebook to create an interactive model for `empymod`. All there is to do is to load the widgets, define the desired sliders, create a plot function as we have done for the examples before, and subsequently call `interact`. In the example, I include three sliders: one for the resistivity of the target layer, one for the depth of the target layer, and one for the thickness of the target layer. Five additional lines of code are all that is required to generate this interactive modeler: one line to import the required functions, three lines to define the three sliders, and a last line to activate the interaction. The result is shown in Figure 4.\n",
