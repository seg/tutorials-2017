	Abstract = {
            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

As such DSLs provide a powerful mechanism to speed up scientific Python computation that goes beyond traditional vectorization and pre-compilation approaches, while allowing domain scientists to build applications within the comforts of the Python software ecosystem. In this paper we present Devito, a new finite difference DSL that provides optimized stencil computation from high-level problem specifications based on symbolic Python expressions. We demonstrate Devito{\textquoteright}s symbolic API and performance advantages over traditional Python acceleration methods before highlighting its use in the scientific context of seismic inversion problems.},

	Abstract = {Often, parameter estimation problems of parameter-dependent PDEs involve multiple right-hand sides. The computational cost and memory requirements of such problems increase linearly with the number of right-hand sides. For many applications this is the main bottleneck of the computation. In this paper we show that problems with multiple right-hand sides can be reformulated as stochastic programming problems by combining the right-hand sides into a few {\quotedblbase}simultaneous{\textquotedblright} sources. This effectively reduces the cost of the forward problem and results in problems that are much cheaper to solve. We discuss two solution methodologies: namely sample average approximation and stochastic approximation. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach we present two model problems, direct current resistivity and seismic tomography.},

	year = {2017},
	note = {Submitted to ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software on February 14, 2017.},
	abstract = {Large scale parameter estimation problems are some of the most computationally demanding problems. An academic researcher{\textquoteright}s domain-specific knowledge often precludes that of software design, which results in software frameworks for inversion that are technically correct, but not scalable to realistically-sized problems. On the other hand, the computational demands of the problem for realistic problems result in industrial codebases that are geared solely for performance, rather than comprehensibility or flexibility. We propose a new software design that bridges the gap between these two seemingly disparate worlds. A hierarchical and modular design allows a user to delve into as much detail as she desires, while using high performance primitives at the lower levels. Our code has the added benefit of actually reflecting the underlying mathematics of the problem, which lowers the cognitive load on user using it and reduces the initial startup period before a researcher can be fully productive. We also introduce a new preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation that is suitable for fault-tolerant distributed systems. Numerical experiments on a variety of 2D and 3D test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on scaling algorithms from small to large scale problems with minimal code changes.},
